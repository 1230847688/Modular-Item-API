## v1.1.0 (1.20.1)
- fixed Obsidian giving Attackspeed on armor
- fixed bug adding a Tag to items picked up while Miapi installed.  
It is NOT recommended to upgrade exisiting worlds.  
This version fixed a bug where items would be made stackable only with other bugged Items.  
This means now updating will make Items nolonger stack due to fixing this bug
- Added new module extension format to easily extend and change modules for addons
- added compat with Apotheosis
